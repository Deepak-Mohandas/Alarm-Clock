# Alarm Clock With Python

It is no doubt that an alarm clock is always handy to alert us whenever we sleep, take a short nap, or to remind us about the work, we always get oblivious about.

Python consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter which help me to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.

# Installation - Prerequisites

### pip install tkinter

### pip install datetime

### pip install winaudio

### python GUI (Graphic User Interface)


   - Tkinter module belongs to a standard library of GUI in Python. It helps me to create a dialog box with any information that we want to provide or get from the users.
   - Datetime and time modules in python help me to work with the dates and time of the current day when the user is operating python and to manipulate it too.
   - Winsound module provides access to the basic sound playing machinery provided by Windows platforms. This is useful to generate the sound immediately when a function is called.
   - python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. 
   - Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
